👋 About Me
I'm an AI Architect and an Information Science Engineering student at JSSSTU, Mysore, with a proven track record of designing and building complex, multi-agent AI systems that win.

My passion is turning ambitious ideas into robust, user-centric applications. I thrive under pressure and love the challenge of architecting a complete system from the ground up, as demonstrated by my recent 1st Place win at the Hackfusion 1.0 Hackathon for our project, FinAI.

🚀 Building: End-to-end AI systems with LangChain, FastAPI, and MongoDB.

🤖 Specializing In: Multi-agent architecture, Explainable AI (XAI), and RAG.

🧠 Mastering: Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ via the NeetCode 150 grind.

🏆 Achievements: Two-time 1st Place winner in major AI/Generative AI competitions.

🏆 Key Achievements
🥇 1st Place Winner, Hackfusion 1.0 (MIT Mysore): Led the architecture and development of FinAI, a 4-agent financial advisor, beating 30+ teams in a 48-hour competition.

🥇 1st Place Winner, GenAI Visionaries Case Competition (IIM Mumbai): Designed and presented a winning solution for analyzing financial transcripts using fine-tuned LLMs to a panel including Prof. David Simchi-Levi from MIT.
